Generate missing parts of Kafka's novels!

# Scope of the project 
In this project I want to generate the missing parts of Franz Kafka's novels (The Trial, The Castle and Amerika) using LLM models. 

# Limitations
Due to technical issues I decided to start with easily available models using ollama library and basic prompts. 
The next step will be the following: 
1. Use larger models 
2. Use openai API 
3. Finetune models 

# Other tasks: 
- find an easily readable format for output. 
- find the average number of words and characters for The Trial. 
- format outputs and convert to PDF 
# Models
